**Refraction index**

This python script is designed to calculate n and k, the components of the complex refractive index, which can be derived from the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric matrix. The dielectric matrix is derived from the optical properties calculation using VASP. 

The output of this script contains dataFrame csv file of the n and k values along in-plane and out-of-plane direction, the plot and smooth plot of the n and k for three strucutres.
